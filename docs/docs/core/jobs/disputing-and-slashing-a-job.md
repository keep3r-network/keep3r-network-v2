# Disputing and Slashing a Job

## Disputed Job
A job might be disputed by a [disputer](https://docs.keep3r.network/roles/disputer) if there is suspicious activity detected within that job.
A good behavior is expected from jobs, this includes but isn't limited to:
- NOT leverage the network of keepers for malicious activities (exploits, rug pulls, etc.).
- NOT limiting qualified keepers to work on their job.
- NOT creating a malicious workable function to drain credits from the network.
In case it's disputed, the job won't be able to be worked by keepers, withdraw LPs / tokens credits nor perform a job migration.

## Slashed Jobs
Jobs that are detected to have a malicious behavior within the network (either towards the network or the protocol they are working for â€” eg: exploiting a protocol) will get their LP tokens slashed and seized by governance.
