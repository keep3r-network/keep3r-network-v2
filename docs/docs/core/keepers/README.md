# Introduction

Keepers are simply EOA accounts or smart contracts that will execute a function inside a Job contract. 

Each time you execute such a function, you will be rewarded in either tokens or the system's native token KP3R.

Jobs might require keepers to have a minimum amount of bonded tokens, have earned a minimum amount of fees, or have been in the system for a certain period of time.

At the simplest level, they require a keeper to be registered in the system.
