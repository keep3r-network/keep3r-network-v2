# Disputing and Slashing a Keeper

## Disputed Keeper
A Keeper might be disputed by a [disputer](https://docs.keep3r.network/roles/disputer) if there is suspicious activity detected within that keeper.
A good behavior is expected from keepers, this includes but isn't limited to:
- NOT working a malicious job
- NOT sandwiching a job
In case it's disputed, the keeper won't be able to bond or activate new assets nor withdraw its unbonded assets.

## Slashed Keeper
Keepers that are detected to have a malicious behavior within the network (either towards the network or the protocol they are working for â€” eg: sandwiching a job) will get their bonded assets slashed and seized by governance
