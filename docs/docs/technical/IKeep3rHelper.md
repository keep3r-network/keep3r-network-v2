## `IKeep3rHelper`

Contains all the helper functions used throughout the different files.




### `quote(uint256 _eth) → uint256 _amountOut` (external)

Calculates the amount of KP3R that corresponds to the ETH passed into the function


This function allows us to calculate how much KP3R we should pay to a keeper for things expressed in ETH, like gas


### `bonds(address _keeper) → uint256 _amountBonded` (external)

Returns the amount of KP3R the keeper has bonded




### `getRewardAmountFor(address _keeper, uint256 _gasUsed) → uint256 _kp3r` (external)

Calculates the reward (in KP3R) that corresponds to a keeper for using gas




### `getRewardBoostFor(uint256 _bonds) → uint256 _rewardBoost` (external)

Calculates the boost in the reward given to a keeper based on the amount of KP3R that keeper has bonded




### `getRewardAmount(uint256 _gasUsed) → uint256 _amount` (external)

Calculates the reward (in KP3R) that corresponds to tx.origin for using gas




### `getPoolTokens(address _pool) → address _token0, address _token1` (external)

Given a pool address, returns the underlying tokens of the pair




### `isKP3RToken0(address _pool) → bool _isKP3RToken0` (external)

Defines the order of the tokens in the pair for twap calculations




### `observe(address _pool, uint32[] _secondsAgo) → int56 _tickCumulative1, int56 _tickCumulative2, bool _success` (external)

Given an array of secondsAgo, returns UniswapV3 pool cumulatives at that moment




### `getPaymentParams(uint256 _bonds) → uint256 _boost, uint256 _oneEthQuote, uint256 _extra` (external)

Get multiplier, quote, and extra, in order to calculate keeper payment




### `getKP3RsAtTick(uint256 _liquidityAmount, int56 _tickDifference, uint256 _timeInterval) → uint256 _kp3rAmount` (external)

Given a tick and a liquidity amount, calculates the underlying KP3R tokens




### `getQuoteAtTick(uint128 _baseAmount, int56 _tickDifference, uint256 _timeInterval) → uint256 _quoteAmount` (external)

Given a tick and a token amount, calculates the output in correspondant token
