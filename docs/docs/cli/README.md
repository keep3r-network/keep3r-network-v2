# CLI

Keep3r-CLI provides an easy-to-use tool along with all the necessary code required to run your own keeper and start working on jobs. All you need to provide is your configuration file.

#### For Keepers
The easiest to become a keeper and start earning rewards for working jobs is by using the CLI. After cloning the CLI you will need to install CLI compatible jobs, add your configuration, and hit play! For more information you can read the complete CLI Documentation.


#### For Job Owners
If you are planning to add your job to the Keep3r Network, making it CLI compatible would be the quickest way to fully integrate it into the network. This will allow Keepers to install it and start working it in a minute or less. For more information you can read our CLI Sample Jobs.
