# Governance

Keep3r Governance by design has a low overhead, it is not meant to be protocol intensive.
The tasks governance has are:
- [Managing slashers](managing-slashers)
- [Managing disputers](managing-disputers)
- [Managing protocol parameters](managing-protocol-parameters)
- [Managing approved liquidities](manage-approved-liquidities)
- [Force-minting credits to a job](force-liquidity-credits)
The focus of governance, however, is mainly put on reviewing jobs and, if absolutely required, mitigating disputes or blacklisting keepers.
